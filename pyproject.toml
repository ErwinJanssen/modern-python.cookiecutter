    # - Conflicts with `no-blank-line-before-class` (D211).
    "D203",  # one-blank-line-before-class

    # - Conflicts with `multi-line-summary-first-line` (D212).
    "D213",  # multi-line-summary-second-line

    "COM812",  # trailing-comma-on-bare-tuple
    "ISC001",  # single-line-implicit-string-concatenation
]
# These rules are ignored for now, but can be enabled once violations are
# resolved.
